# AWS Lambda EC2 Instance Management

This project provides two AWS Lambda functions to manage EC2 instances â€” one for starting an EC2 instance and another for stopping an EC2 instance. These Lambda functions are designed to be easily configured and deployed in AWS, and can be used for automation tasks such as starting or stopping instances based on certain triggers.

## Features
- Automate EC2 instance start/stop operations.
- Lightweight serverless architecture using AWS Lambda.
- Customizable region and instance IDs.
- Error handling included for robustness.

## Requirements
- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions.
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- AWS Lambda configured for Python runtime.
- Boto3 library (AWS SDK for Python).
