# AWS Lambda EC2 Instance Management

This project provides two AWS Lambda functions to manage EC2 instances â€” one for starting an EC2 instance and another for stopping an EC2 instance. These Lambda functions are designed to be easily configured and deployed in AWS, and can be used for automation tasks such as starting or stopping instances based on certain triggers.

## Features
- Automate EC2 instance start/stop operations.
- Lightweight serverless architecture using AWS Lambda.
- Customizable region and instance IDs.
- Error handling included for robustness.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the Lambda functions, ensure that you have the following:

- AWS Account: You must have an AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to manage EC2 instances.
- AWS Lambda Permissions: Your Lambda execution role must have permissions to interact with EC2 instances (`ec2:StartInstances` and `ec2:StopInstances`).
- boto3: This script uses the `boto3` AWS SDK for Python, which is pre-installed in AWS Lambda runtime environments.
